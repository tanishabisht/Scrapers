These firms maintain the official record of all shareholders (see Diagram 1 for place in traditional trading), making them vital for stock splits, dividend distribution, shareholder voting, and more. TAs are the true backend bookkeepers of \"who owns what stock.\"\nHowever, millions of human-processed book-entry stock transfers waste billions of shareholder dollars each year. Furthermore, it oftentimes takes HOURS sitting on the phone to directly transfer book-entry stock, and, for this sub-par shareholder service, firms waste 6+ figures/yr (over 1.44B last year in the US alone) for a trusted central point of failure. The whole process in general is slow, tedious, wasteful, and incredibly lucrative, as the central bookkeeping trust creates one of the highest-margin businesses in all of public finance.\nThe role of transfer agents today represents a gross misallocation of shareholder dollars that must be haulted. Blockchain was created for the sole purpose of maintaining ledgers just like a TA ledger, and smart contracts (and our subsequent dApp) enable intelligent execution of a decentralized finance TA protocol. This means that anyone can access and transfer their assets instantaneously, prove their ownership stake with no central trust, verify other shareholder stakes, vote at shareholder meetings without proxy middlemen, and more with no central point of failure... all while significantly lowering the TA expense for the underlying since cost comes from distributed gas fees (not arbitrary agent profit).\nWe came into the hackathon with a general outline of how we wanted our smart contracts to function, and finished it strong with a seamless Web3 interface for stock transfer agent services. Through equity backed by contractual transfer agent obligations with the underlying, we've laid out the groundwork for global decentralized equities."}, {"idNo": 2, "name": "Cleopatra", "desc": "A Blockchain paradigm, at your service.", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/cleopatra-be76", "githubLinks": ["https://github.com/RankJay/Cleopatra", "https://twitter.com/Cleopat51842118"], "special_mention": " ", "stacksUsed": ["Python", "Chainlink", "Web3.py"], "longDesc": "The problem Cleopatra solves\nCleopatra, at its core, is a multi-purpose Twitter bot that can constantly push forward the user engagement of a decentralized ecosystem.\nImagine, you are at a break/or on a weekend spending your leisure time on social media, especially Twitter, looking for some trends and good times, and suddenly you recall, you forgot to check the CoinMarketCap of your crypto and don't want to grab or your laptop or go to the website!

Cleopatra is here to automate tasks for you, the really cool thing about this giveaway is that it actually picks \"RANDOM\" users. How? Well using the ChainLink's VRF API, to sustain the oracle problem, this bot, after getting through some dramatic algorithm shifts, which is solely based on randomness provided by the API, get you your giveaway winners, and at the same time, will send out DMs to each one, for the process of how to avail them! Cool isn't it? To put the verifiable randomness of blockchain to use. Apart from these features, the bot is also designed to provide all these details apart from normal chatting exclusively via DMs, just in case you don't want to let the world know you hold XYZ crypto.

A common-input-ownership heuristic exists which states that if a transaction has more than one input then all those inputs are owned by the same entity.\nThis is one of the core heuristics used by chain analysis companies to determine the owner of specific unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs). UTXOs can be attributed ownership based on economic activity patterns, lack of privacy controls, and a false understanding of how UTXOs are processed in a bitcoin transaction.\nFor those that wish to retain a higher level of privacy, solutions such as multisignature, CoinSwap, CoinJoin, and Payjoin exist -- but are not easily accessible to the common user, as most of these solutions require in-depth technical knowledge of the Bitcoin protocol and administration of infrastructure that can sync and store and maintain chain data. An additional knowledge set of how to construct, parse, and sign partially signed bitcoin transaction (PSBT) data is required for enhanced privacy features. Most end users without this level of technical acumen will fail at implementing the specification properly, and will ultimately sacrifice security and privacy of their funds and transactions for the sake of conveinence."}, {"idNo": 8, "name": "Bitcoin Backup Helper", "desc": "Build your own Bitcoin backup sheet", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/bitcoin-backup-helper-88c3", "githubLinks": ["https://bit.ly/3cLwk6f"], "special_mention": " ", "stacksUsed": ["Figma", "HTML/CSS"], "longDesc": "The problem Bitcoin Backup Helper solves\nBacking up your bitcoin wallet is critical, but it can be complicated for newer users.
