But doing this physically is not feasible. Working in CS requires being able to work efficiently in teams. But many students just slack off as they are unable to form/find a team. There\u2019s also lack of social awareness towards nature and how important contributions are, may those be for social good or personal development for a student. With Alute, we aim at tackling both of these problems with a single solution.\nOur solution\nAlute - Learn and Contribute where users will easily be able to find projects and teams, or create a new one too. Creating and joining will be totally customized and easy. Using the credits they earn on our platform, they can be a part of social contributions as well get personal benefits.

It is the foundation in achieving gender equality. It will create a safer environment that can encourage women to step out of their homes without any worry which will also increase their productivity and give them the confidence to explore opportunities in various fields.\nWe are building a website to have a solution which will help to curb sexual assault pandemic. Firstly the user will login themselves then the contact information of their five guardians would be asked.Now if the user is feeling unsafe or just wants to check in, a live location can be activated and can be shared with guardians. It is able to discreetly trigger an emergency alert with a double-press, instantly transmitting location information to selected contacts. If you do send an alert, it lets your guardians navigate to your location. This feature is useful to help people reach you quickly. In this way it will be able to keep users safe through these SOS features. One of its applications enables users to enter their start point and destination, in case they feel the route is unsafe. The location of the device can be tracked real time.We have also added the virtual facetime,audio illusion in the application as sometimes it may happen that you feel unsafe in the path you are travelling and you have no one to talk to you can use talk to me feature. If you are at home sometimes you feel like nothing to do you can also learn self defence through get the self defense training option. Of Course our application will also cover basic features like editing your profile,notification bar, chat with guardians,etc. If this part will get implemented successfully then we will add some more features like professional chatbot from which you can talk to professionals/police/1098 facilities,unique trigger speech system that allows you to add a unique word of your choice and trigger the alert by the unique word just like okay google."}, {"idNo": 2, "name": "OPEN UP!", "desc": "It is an emotional support platform providing a group of qualified Psycologists.If feeling sad or depressed you can Chat & share with us completely anonymously and recieve advice from therapist (free)", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/open-up-248b", "githubLinks": ["https://github.com/nandika2709/OpenUp-Sis-Code-Clan-SheHacksDTU/tree/master"], "special_mention": " ", "stacksUsed": ["Bootstrap", "CSS", "JavaScript", "Socket.IO", "Express.js", "Nodejs", "HTML5"], "longDesc": "The problem OPEN UP! solves\nAccording to study, 43% Indians suffer from depression.

There is urgency in obtaining accurate data to better prepare healthcare systems and avoid collapse.\nOur model does this by enabling hospitals to manage their resources efficiently, since huge demand and short supply of resources like ICU beds has led to a resource crunch. Based on the individual clinical data, our model predicts (at early stages of hospital admission) which patients will need ICU support. This helps in the following ways:\nHospitals allocate ICU resources efficiently and make sure there is no shortage. This enables more targeted patient care to avoid high-risk patients\u2019 deterioration and consequent need for ICU admission.\nHospitals can discharge stable patients confidently if the model predicts low risk for ICU admission, thus freeing up resources for those who need them.\nSmaller hospitals will be able to gauge the no. of ICUs required, based on the hospital\u2019s patient database.

You can navigate the nearest systems/boxes present through this site and can put your leftover food into it. Our members will take out that food from the respective systems and give the edible checked food to the people who're dying of hunger.\nSecondly, We are working on Donating school supplies that will help poor students in their education without worrying about their financial conditions.
