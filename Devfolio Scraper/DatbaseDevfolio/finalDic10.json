So what to do for these?\nExisting solutions\nThis calls for a easy but viable solution to counter all these peeping toms. Some are already in the market like a 2500 INR Filter Screen, or locking your screen everytime someone looks at your laptop, or asking them to shoo away and handling awkward questions like \"What is it that you are doing that you have to hide it?\"\nOur Solution\nThese solutions are not really the best ones, so why not identify certain points of senstivity in the webapps (like gmeet, zoom and slack, which we have handled specifically in this project) and simply blur them! To reveal / unblur them, all you need to do is hover over it. To keep the solution as accessible and compact, we chose a browser extension - MeetInPeace ( which is of size < 1 MB )\nTo make the accessibility even quicker, all you need to do is use \"Alt + X\" as the hotkey to toggle this extension On / Off to keep your privacy secure quickly.\nHow it works?\nWe blur the sensitive areas on toggle using custom CSS and DOM manipulation, which is initiated on onCheck listeners attached to the popup.\nFinal Aim\nOur aim is to make this solution more accessible to everyone, for that we can't really make a custom tab for each webapp in our extension.\nSo, our final aim is to allow the user to mark the specifc areas of the web page as sensitive areas and toggle blurring / unblurring them as required."}, {"idNo": 3, "name": "Eco Map", "desc": "A guide for reducing your Carbon Footprint using CryptoCurrency & also towards a green & Carbon neutral future!", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/eco-map-a3c6", "githubLinks": ["https://github.com/d-rorschach/Eco-Map", "https://eco-map.herokuapp.com/"], "special_mention": " ", "stacksUsed": ["HTML", "Bootstrap", "CSS", "Django", "JavaScript", "Heroku", "Python", "Geocoding", "Mapbox API", "Portis"], "longDesc": "The problem Eco Map solves\nMain Idea:\nIn this project, we have tried to incorporate Crypto-Currency with Carbon Footprint.

So we have provided the user with some resources to actually understand the theoretical definition as well as the practical application of these terms.\nHow much CO2 the user generates every time they travel by their Car, so the app will calculate it as users will select their destination and their mode of travel. The app will also show the equivalent Carbon Offset in INR and Ether.\nOnce the user understands the concepts of Carbon Footprint, Carbon Offset, and Carbon Neutrality, they can keep a Detailed Record of their Offset Contribution.\nThe user will have an option to neutralize their Carbon Offset by Donating an amount(Using Portis Wallet) proportional to their Carbon Offset, towards Tree Plantation."}, {"idNo": 4, "name": "LEARNING GLOW-REVOLUTION WE NEEDED", "desc": "The Revolutionized way of learning free of cost.", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/learning-glowrevolution-we-needed-30d5", "githubLinks": ["https://abhi070902.github.io/Learning-Glow/", "https://github.com/abhi070902/Learning-Glow"], "special_mention": " ", "stacksUsed": ["Bootstrap", "JavaScript", "Java", "Android Studio", "Image-to-Image Translation", "Google Forms", "Google OAuth", "CSS3", "HTML5", "Google Firebase"], "longDesc": "The problem LEARNING GLOW-REVOLUTION WE NEEDED solves\nWith the learning glow project we want to solve the problem that we faced during our preparation time that is the teacher was either to fast or slow we were not able to keep up with the pace of teacher.So in this project we are trying to solve this problem by giving every student module according to his need and without any cost.He just have to answer the question asked in google form related to his academics and after that we will take short test of him and will give module most suited for him for his desired competitive exam .
