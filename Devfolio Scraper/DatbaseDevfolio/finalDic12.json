It contains both train and test datasets for the different soil types. We have 5 hidden layers in the model. Our first layer is sequential as there's only a single input. Since it is a picture we need to flatten the RGB content. We have then used batch normalisation layer to normalise the mean output and standard deviation. Then we have densely connected 4 layers. Again, to normalise the output we have used batch normalisation and we have used the activation function 'softmax'. We have compiled the whole model using optimiser 'Adam' , handled losses using 'categoricalCrossentropy' and using metrics 'accuracy'. We have set up 50 epochs for better accuracy.

Due to unintended tremors in their arms, patients are unable to perform everyday menial tasks like eating food out of a bowl with a spoon.\nThe stabilizing spoon compensates for unintended tremors or shivers received from the user and calibrates its head against these forces, thus keeping the spoon bowl stable at all times. This spoon can move as quickly as 500\u00b0/second, hence effectively steadying the spoon and easing the eating process of patients.\nAnother part of the holistic product is a mobile application for a designated doctor to monitor the patient\u2019s progress. \nDuring this pandemic, people have been terrified of entering hospitals for non-COVID diseases and ailments, and we aim to create and market a product to help people adjust better to this new norm.\nWe have developed an application that analyses data collected from the spoon via sensors and statistically displays it to the designated doctor. By using this application, a doctor can not only monitor your progress but also offer diagnosis and treatment remotely, without the patient needing to leave their home.\nWith this project, the absolute aim is to make a product that can make a patient\u2019s life easier.\nThe product will not only make it easy for the user to eat food out of a plate/bowl but also help their recovery by enabling inexpensive and thorough communication with a designated doctor.\nIn an age where people are petrified of the thought of entering the premises of a hospital, we are trying to use all the technical experience we have to create an experience that avoids as much physical contact as possible.\nIn the case of neuro diseases associated with nerves and muscles, it is imperative for the doctor to check up on the patient\u2019s movements regularly, but we have attempted to find a way for doing that without requiring the patient to ever enter a hospital."}, {"idNo": 9, "name": "Prayog", "desc": "Do science practicals virtually by speaking. no more practicals memorisation:)", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/prayog-1598", "githubLinks": ["https://github.com/AkshaySharmaDEV/Prayog3d", "https://akshaysharmadev.itch.io/prayog"], "special_mention": "Winners", "stacksUsed": ["Blender", "Unity3d", "C#", "windows speech"], "longDesc": "The problem Prayog solves\nwe are working on theme \"Quality Education\".
