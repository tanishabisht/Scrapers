Whether it's studies, food ordering or jobs we all faced several challenges and the only help to us during this time was the internet. Whether we agree or not, the world is moving towards digitalization at a very rapid rate. Several services are getting digitalized. Thinking about the same we came up with an idea of why we can\u2019t make our railway journeys much more easier, especially that part of the journey off the train. Think of how clumsy it gets when you're carrying huge luggages and searching for coolies everywhere in the station and then bargaining with them. The idea of our project is to save time and efforts for you by finding a coolie. You can now book your coolie before you even reach the station. If you are a patient or with disability you need not worry. We have got a service to book wheelchairs at railway stations which will be made ready for you before your arrival. On the other hand, this app benefits coolies and gets customers to them through one click of a button who otherwise had to literally run beside passengers to get a pickup. Currently the realization of the idea only contains baggage pickup and wheelchair services. But the idea doesn't stop here, in future we also think to add more services for both the users and coolie, using which they can benefit a lot.\nWith digitalization and the stablishment of free wifi and services at railway stations, we are moving towards the path of hightech railways stations. The availablity of 24/7 internet facility makes the task for the coolie easier. They just need a smartphone availability and they are all set to operate the services provided by the app. Looking at many ongoing services outside the railway stations like Swiggy, Zomato, Urban Clap, Uber, and Ola we feel that someday it's possible to get a facility like these into the stations as well."}, {"idNo": 1, "name": "Hit Beat", "desc": "The Most Practical approach to learn BeatBoxing, beat by beat.", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/hit-beat-db8f", "githubLinks": ["https://github.com/rishavnaskar/hitbeat", "https://github.com/Akshat1903/Hack-Ingenium", "https://www.figma.com/file/cA2lXbpCzvimGDKZvlbI0z/Tech-Ingenium?node-id=0%3A1", "https://www.figma.com/file/cA2lXbpCzvimGDKZvlbI0z/Tech-Ingenium?node-id=109%3A0"], "special_mention": " ", "stacksUsed": ["Dart", "LibROSA", "Python", "Figma", "AWS", "RestAPIs"], "longDesc": "The problem Hit Beat solves\nMusic comes from practice not from books. \nProblems:\n1.)

There is not even a single App where the Beat Boxing enthusiast can actually evaluate his/her progress and practise it the right way. \n3.)There are 100's of different sounds in Beat Boxing like lip roller, Siren, clip roller etc and to master beatboxing in general, you need to work on every sound separately.\nso to tackle these problems, Our Team: \"Console.log()\" has made an Educational yet fun product called \"Hit Beat\" by which the user can select a sound which he/she wants to practise and then just by listening to it (for say Clip roller) & recording it, the user will get a score out of 100. Now the user can keep practising that particular sound and try to improve the score(or you may say his/her BeatBoxing skill).\nFor Future work: We will be adding the Challenge Tab where Beat Boxers can challenge each other and will learn from each other. It will also make our business model stronger.

This spoon can move as quickly as 500\u00b0/second, hence effectively steadying the spoon and easing the eating process of patients.\nAnother part of the holistic product is a mobile application for a designated doctor to monitor the patient\u2019s progress.\nDuring this pandemic, people have been terrified of entering hospitals for non-COVID diseases and ailments, and we aim to create and market a product to help people adjust better to this new norm.\nWe have developed an application that analyses data collected from the spoon via sensors and statistically displays it to the designated doctor. By using this application, a doctor can not only monitor your progress but also offer diagnosis and treatment remotely, without the patient needing to leave their home.\nWith this project, the absolute aim is to make a product that can make a patient\u2019s life easier.\nThe product will not only make it easy for the user to eat food out of a plate/bowl but also help their recovery by enabling inexpensive and thorough communication with a designated doctor.\nIn an age where people are petrified of the thought of entering the premises of a hospital, we are trying to use all the technical experience we have to create an experience that avoids as much physical contact as possible.\nIn the case of neuro diseases associated with nerves and muscles, it is imperative for the doctor to check up on the patient\u2019s movements regularly, but we have attempted to find a way for doing that without requiring the patient to ever enter a hospital."}, {"idNo": 5, "name": "Lingenium", "desc": "Tired if waiting at the restaurant?
