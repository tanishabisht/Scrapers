Whether it's studies, food ordering or jobs we all faced several challenges and the only help to us during this time was the internet. Whether we agree or not, the world is moving towards digitalization at a very rapid rate. Several services are getting digitalized. Thinking about the same we came up with an idea of why we can\u2019t make our railway journeys much more easier, especially that part of the journey off the train. Think of how clumsy it gets when you're carrying huge luggages and searching for coolies everywhere in the station and then bargaining with them. The idea of our project is to save time and efforts for you by finding a coolie. You can now book your coolie before you even reach the station. If you are a patient or with disability you need not worry. We have got a service to book wheelchairs at railway stations which will be made ready for you before your arrival. On the other hand, this app benefits coolies and gets customers to them through one click of a button who otherwise had to literally run beside passengers to get a pickup. Currently the realization of the idea only contains baggage pickup and wheelchair services. But the idea doesn't stop here, in future we also think to add more services for both the users and coolie, using which they can benefit a lot.\nWith digitalization and the stablishment of free wifi and services at railway stations, we are moving towards the path of hightech railways stations. The availablity of 24/7 internet facility makes the task for the coolie easier. They just need a smartphone availability and they are all set to operate the services provided by the app. Looking at many ongoing services outside the railway stations like Swiggy, Zomato, Urban Clap, Uber, and Ola we feel that someday it's possible to get a facility like these into the stations as well."}, {"idNo": 17, "name": "Hassle-free grocery shopping in COVID-19", "desc": "2 gaz duri, app hai zaruri!", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/hasslefree-grocery-shopping-in-covid-2f88", "githubLinks": ["https://github.com/divya-gupta-2499/The_Farzi_Rockstars"], "special_mention": " ", "stacksUsed": ["Java", "SQL", "JSP", "Spring Framework", "JDBC", "Maven", "Tomcat"], "longDesc": "The problem Hassle-free grocery shopping in COVID-19 solves\nIn times of COVID-19, social distancing has become of utmost importance.

To enhance grocery shopping experience, we aim to introduce the concept of \"Takeaway Shopping\", similar to Takeaway food deliveries offered by many food chain partners. Our concept enables the user to select the products they need to shop, wherein they also put up an estimated pickup time. This will be entered by the user during checkout, while also paying for the items purchased. This will help in preventing crowding at billing centres at such shops, which is needed to contain the spread of COVID-19. Vendors have also been adversely affected due to COVID with lockdown being imposed in the entire country, hampering their sales and their daily meals. Some have also suffered to earn bread for their family members. Our webapp provides the option to partner up with the store, wherein they can sell their products at our quoted price.

So, what if we can track the scrolling behaviour, understand where they stop and recommend based on that.\nMost of the user's time goes wasted in scrolling content that he/she isn\u2019t interested in. To understand their interest, their scrolling behaviour can be tracked. Point where they stop scrolling and spend some time viewing the content shows that they are interested in that content. So, our idea is to retrieve the products when scrolling stops, get similar products to that using ML techniques and display that at their point of scroll. We can aslo display ads instead of recommendations.\nTo track the user\u2019s scroll behavior, we use Javascript. The JavaScript detects the scrolling activity. It also creates a div with an id which is used to display the data present on the screen. Once, the user stops scrolling, we extract the product present in that div tag and send it to the recommendation system.
