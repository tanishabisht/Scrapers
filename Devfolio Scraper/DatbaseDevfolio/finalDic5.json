But what if we also wanted a small clip of the lecture or we also wanted to crop a particular portion of lecture.

After adding videos, they can select a particular video and start watching it.It maybe a youtube video or an offline video.\nWhenever, they wish to get a small portion cut out and saved in the notes section, they can click on the timestamps and automatically a video cut out will be generated in the notes. \nSimultaneously, they can write their own notes in any font/format, insert links/images.\nAlso, they can generate text notes of whatever was said by just a click.
