Due to unintended tremors in their arms, patients are unable to perform everyday menial tasks like eating food out of a bowl with a spoon.\nThe stabilizing spoon compensates for unintended tremors or shivers received from the user and calibrates its head against these forces, thus keeping the spoon bowl stable at all times. This spoon can move as quickly as 500\u00b0/second, hence effectively steadying the spoon and easing the eating process of patients.\nAnother part of the holistic product is a mobile application for a designated doctor to monitor the patient\u2019s progress.\nDuring this pandemic, people have been terrified of entering hospitals for non-COVID diseases and ailments, and we aim to create and market a product to help people adjust better to this new norm.\nWe have developed an application that analyses data collected from the spoon via sensors and statistically displays it to the designated doctor. By using this application, a doctor can not only monitor your progress but also offer diagnosis and treatment remotely, without the patient needing to leave their home.\nWith this project, the absolute aim is to make a product that can make a patient\u2019s life easier.\nThe product will not only make it easy for the user to eat food out of a plate/bowl but also help their recovery by enabling inexpensive and thorough communication with a designated doctor.\nIn an age where people are petrified of the thought of entering the premises of a hospital, we are trying to use all the technical experience we have to create an experience that avoids as much physical contact as possible.\nIn the case of neuro diseases associated with nerves and muscles, it is imperative for the doctor to check up on the patient\u2019s movements regularly, but we have attempted to find a way for doing that without requiring the patient to ever enter a hospital."}, {"idNo": 1, "name": "CloseBuy", "desc": "An end-to-end hyperlocal platform to connect local entrepreneurs with customers within their location and equipping them with tools to bring their services online and find customers quickly and easily", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/closebuy-3b39", "githubLinks": ["https://github.com/anubhab-code/Team-Phasors"], "special_mention": "Runner Up Prize", "stacksUsed": ["Firebase", "Flask", "Flutter", "Google Maps API", "Matic", "Geocoding", "Blockchain", "Firestore", "Moibit", "Tezos"], "longDesc": "The problem CloseBuy solves\nLocal entreprenuers lack exposure of their small businesses due to societal constraints.\nThese local entreprenuers find difficulty in acquiring initial customers and scaling their business.\nNormal consumers have to spend a lot of time looking for a good tailor for tight deadlines for an event or house helps , baby sitters or any other work , nearby."}, {"idNo": 2, "name": "ANUVAAD", "desc": "Translating Education For Future", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/anuvaad-bb16", "githubLinks": ["https://github.com/gauranshkumar/ANUVAAD", "https://github.com/thisisamank/anuvaad-flutter"], "special_mention": "Winning Prize", "stacksUsed": ["Machine Learning", "Docker", "Flutter", "API"], "longDesc": "The problem ANUVAAD solves\nProblem\nWe have enormous high quality educational content already available on the Internet, but there is a major issue which leads to limited utilisation of it. \nThe issue we have is language.\nMany of the people have problem in understanding english or foreign language which degrades the quality of the content that is present there and hence, language becomes a barrier in learning.\nSolution\nOur solution to the given problem is that we are going to build \u201cANUVAAD\u201d a tool to translate any video lecture or any technical stuff into the regional language of the user.\nOur Major goal is to utilise the already available high quality content by translating them to the native language of the user, Imparting \"Quality Education\"."}, {"idNo": 3, "name": "Healthy Me", "desc": "Buliding future healthy", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/healthy-me-1d4b", "githubLinks": ["https://vaibhavgupta05.github.io/Healthy-Me/", "https://github.com/Vaibhavgupta05/Healthy-Me"], "special_mention": " ", "stacksUsed": ["jQuery", "HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript"], "longDesc": "The problem Healthy Me solves\nProvides an all in one solution for all your medical needs"}, {"idNo": 4, "name": "Wanda", "desc": "Wanda intends to be a single, unified platform for people to find curated, high-quality resources for their topics of interest from fellow software developers. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/healthhub-36c8", "githubLinks": ["https://github.com/vrushti-mody/WandaVision"], "special_mention": " ", "stacksUsed": ["JavaScript", "CSS3", "HTML5"], "longDesc": "The problem Wanda solves\nWhat is Wanda?\nWanda intends to be a single, unified platform for people new to the technology and software development to find curated, high-quality resources for their topics of interest from fellow software developers. \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb\nOur Online Study Room is freely available to help with your motivation and make progress with your work.

But one user behavior that did change is the tendency to scroll. Most of the time we spend in an app goes in scrolling, and the remaining few in actual viewing of the content. So, what if we can track the scrolling behaviour, understand where they stop and recommend based on that.\nMost of the user's time goes wasted in scrolling content that he/she isn\u2019t interested in. To understand their interest, their scrolling behaviour can be tracked. Point where they stop scrolling and spend some time viewing the content shows that they are interested in that content. So, our idea is to retrieve the products when scrolling stops, get similar products to that using ML techniques and display that at their point of scroll. We can aslo display ads instead of recommendations.\nTo track the user\u2019s scroll behavior, we use Javascript. The JavaScript detects the scrolling activity. It also creates a div with an id which is used to display the data present on the screen. Once, the user stops scrolling, we extract the product present in that div tag and send it to the recommendation system. After finding the user\u2019s interesting products we intend to find similar products using cosine similarity.
