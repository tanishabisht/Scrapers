Due to unintended tremors in their arms, patients are unable to perform everyday menial tasks like eating food out of a bowl with a spoon.\nThe stabilizing spoon compensates for unintended tremors or shivers received from the user and calibrates its head against these forces, thus keeping the spoon bowl stable at all times. This spoon can move as quickly as 500\u00b0/second, hence effectively steadying the spoon and easing the eating process of patients.\nAnother part of the holistic product is a mobile application for a designated doctor to monitor the patient\u2019s progress.\nDuring this pandemic, people have been terrified of entering hospitals for non-COVID diseases and ailments, and we aim to create and market a product to help people adjust better to this new norm.\nWe have developed an application that analyses data collected from the spoon via sensors and statistically displays it to the designated doctor. By using this application, a doctor can not only monitor your progress but also offer diagnosis and treatment remotely, without the patient needing to leave their home.\nWith this project, the absolute aim is to make a product that can make a patient\u2019s life easier.\nThe product will not only make it easy for the user to eat food out of a plate/bowl but also help their recovery by enabling inexpensive and thorough communication with a designated doctor.\nIn an age where people are petrified of the thought of entering the premises of a hospital, we are trying to use all the technical experience we have to create an experience that avoids as much physical contact as possible.\nIn the case of neuro diseases associated with nerves and muscles, it is imperative for the doctor to check up on the patient\u2019s movements regularly, but we have attempted to find a way for doing that without requiring the patient to ever enter a hospital."}, {"idNo": 2, "name": "Auxiliary", "desc": "An all-in-one utility Chrome extension that will keep you mentally happy and organized and physically fit.", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/auxiliary-6943", "githubLinks": ["https://github.com/Tuntai/Auxiliary-Version-2.0", "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QYU_TWmjbPZ892BY6QSN0ECeju2Gtw7V1UhyFw-aDiE/edit?usp=sharing"], "special_mention": "6th", "stacksUsed": ["jQuery", "HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "JSON", "Chrome Extension", "Chrome APIs"], "longDesc": "The problem Auxiliary solves\nProblems we have targeted:\nAfter the WFH and online classes have become a new normal, many of us have to sit in front of the computer table continuously for a long time, even for virtual hackathons Participants and Organizers are continuously working for more than 12 hrs.

Most importantly it QUALITY content, STRUCTURED as a course, which is available to anyone for FREE.\nUlarn - A PLACE TO FIND QUALITY CONTENT FROM YOUTUBE, STRUCTURED AS A COURSE, FOR FREE\nLet me give you an example.\nthere is a self-learned web developer called Ram, he learned web development via youtube, which took him really long time to learn as he did not know where to start and what exactly to learn. After a long time, he finally learnt web development, and now he wants to help others like him, by providing DETAILED, STRUCTURED, and FREE content. Now he can use Ularn to make a course by using youtube as the content library. and adding his own notes and tips.
