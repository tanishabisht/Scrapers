Human interaction has decreased a lot over the past few years. In fact, it has all the more with the current pandemic. There are a lot of people who are in isolation, are lonely and just need someone to talk to who can help them out of a rut. Hence our platform consists of volunteers who are trained enough to deal with the situation of people with slight mental incapacities, or with people who are dealing with the burden of their existence. \nOur platform also works as an emergency platform for people who are going through an anxiety/ panic attack. They can navigate through our medically researched UI interface and connect with a volunteer with just a click of a button. \nThe platform has volunteers who are from various universities and are young and open to understand and deal with tough cases, they are trained with a curriculum that allows them to be more open and help more efficiently. \nWe are trying to implement, a similar model as to NHS, UK for the Indians since we cannot depend always on foreign services as our social dynamics and problems are very different compared to other societies.\nOur company will also provide professional medical help to those individuals that are identified by our volunteers to exhibit tendencies around the boundaries of self-harm. The volunteer has a special button that allows him to report in case of emergencies. \nIndia's youth has the highest suicides rates, and that shows how dormant our society is with regards to this situation. One conversation with the right person can make us change our perspective and allow one to live healthier, and that's what EK do.\nWe want every student who is losing his breath at an assignment, every adult burdened under the pressure of society, or every worker who just wanted to share his experience to have an outlet where he can be given a reinforcement to be back the next day with more will power and confidence."}, {"idNo": 1, "name": "ExamTantra", "desc": "Gamify your exams", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/examtantra-27f5", "githubLinks": ["https://github.com/shero4/Hacko-17-COD3ine", "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Va-TlFD3ab7K3gHOzlVY4Z-IFSk7lZKx/view?usp=sharing"], "special_mention": "1st Runner Up", "stacksUsed": ["React", "Firebase", "JavaScript", "Android Studio", "Ionic", "Redux", "Firebase Authentication"], "longDesc": "The problem ExamTantra solves\nCompetitive exams are a cornerstone in almost every student\u2019s life. There are two purposes for competitive exams; at school and college, they encourage students to study by rewarding those who demonstrate the will to learn with reputation, prizes, admissions to universities and scholarships. They're also used in the selection of military and civil service officers. This makes success in these exams very lucrative, attracting many students.\nHowever the archaic education system makes the preparation process very tedious, boring and unintuitive. This leads to burnout and a general disinterest towards academics. This system is also inefficient as it doesn\u2019t have room for a dynamic system of preparation. Another issue that presented itself in the current, unprecedented times is that education has to evolve beyond brick and mortar institutions to function and thrive. The sudden rise in solutions implementing technology into education is no coincidence. As we are forced to look for alternatives to conventional learning methods, we have to find efficient and innovative methods so as to keep improving the quality of education.\nWe decided to create an innovative solution to help students prepare for their exams using ExamTantra. ExamTantra\u2019s goal is to \u201cGamify\u201d the mundane tasks of attempting exams by adding elements such as peer attempts: solving papers with peers resulting in a more productive practice environment, leaderboards to compare progress, a clean minimal UI so as to not distract the user, badges, awards and other reinforcements which have been proven to be psychological motivators. We believe that everyone must have the right to a fair education, thus, ExamTantra aims to make practicing more accessible to students by offering an ad free uninterrupted experience as well as being optimised to run on most devices."}, {"idNo": 2, "name": "Self-Stabilizing Spoon with Remote Monitoring", "desc": "The stabilizing spoon compensates for unintended tremors or shivers and keeps the spoon bowl stable.

This spoon can move as quickly as 500\u00b0/second, hence effectively steadying the spoon and easing the eating process of patients.\nAnother part of the holistic product is a mobile application for a designated doctor to monitor the patient\u2019s progress.\nDuring this pandemic, people have been terrified of entering hospitals for non-COVID diseases and ailments, and we aim to create and market a product to help people adjust better to this new norm.\nWe have developed an application that analyses data collected from the spoon via sensors and statistically displays it to the designated doctor. By using this application, a doctor can not only monitor your progress but also offer diagnosis and treatment remotely, without the patient needing to leave their home.\nWith this project, the absolute aim is to make a product that can make a patient\u2019s life easier.\nThe product will not only make it easy for the user to eat food out of a plate/bowl but also help their recovery by enabling inexpensive and thorough communication with a designated doctor.\nIn an age where people are petrified of the thought of entering the premises of a hospital, we are trying to use all the technical experience we have to create an experience that avoids as much physical contact as possible.\nIn the case of neuro diseases associated with nerves and muscles, it is imperative for the doctor to check up on the patient\u2019s movements regularly, but we have attempted to find a way for doing that without requiring the patient to ever enter a hospital."}, {"idNo": 3, "name": "Yggdrasil", "desc": "knowledge Tree", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/yggdrasil-f937", "githubLinks": ["https://github.com/kushagra1912/Hacko-35-EL-CODEX"], "special_mention": " ", "stacksUsed": ["JavaScript", "CSS3", "HTML5"], "longDesc": "The problem Yggdrasil solves\nstudents can easily find the course of their choice"}, {"idNo": 4, "name": "Vanish Misery", "desc": "Mental Health is preserved Wealth.", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/vanish-misery-17ef", "githubLinks": ["https://github.com/aaryan-gupta/Hacko-24-Nano_coders"], "special_mention": " ", "stacksUsed": ["Bootstrap", "CSS", "JS", "MongoDB", "Passport.js", "Nodejs", "ejs"], "longDesc": "The problem Vanish Misery solves\nOur team believes that health, especially mental health, is a popular concern in today's scenario.
