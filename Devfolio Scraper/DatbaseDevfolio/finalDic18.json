So, the algorithm's main task is to identify the relationship between the sales of the drugs of previous years considering data back from 2014 to the present month in the field of pharmaceutical. After predicting the sales of the current month, it is used by the vendor to predict the amount of stock needed by him for that particular month. It then helps in building a strong supply chain system by directly keeping in contact with the supplier and the vendor. Clinica also has a feature named \"Emergency Need of Stock\" which is available to the vendor in case of need of emergency stock. It can be used when there is a sudden increase in the demand for a particular drug which forces the supplier to increase the supply of that respective drug to avoid the sudden break in the supply chain system. Using Clinica, one can predict the sales of the future too using our API. By predicting the sales of the current month, our system surpasses the problem of the supply chain system.\nSecondly, to tackle the problem of the poor distinction between the branded and the generic medicines, Clinica has a platform for its customers to know about what are generic medicines and how they are different from branded medicines in terms of price and quantity. A platform built to let know its customers about the generic medicines provided under JAS and where a customer has a choice to add a particular medicine to its cart of future references. Our platform is a positive means to spread awareness of the ongoing Govt. scheme. People of don't know the variation of prices in the medicines, our platform shows the same before the eyes of the customer so that they can choose wisely and buy the much better deal."}, {"idNo": 5, "name": "MediSure", "desc": "We have developed a web as well as an Android App(which employs the web app) named MediSure to provide the most economical result matching the prescription using JAS & Open medicinie dataset.", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/medisure-151b", "githubLinks": ["https://iamaj69.pythonanywhere.com/", "https://github.com/iamajitsingh/Medisure-project"], "special_mention": " ", "stacksUsed": ["NumPy", "pandas", "Django 3"], "longDesc": "The problem MediSure solves\nSince the concept of community Pharmacists doesn\u2019t exist in India, the onus for cost reduction from the point of view of drug selection lies with the doctors.

In all countries, the use of generic drugs has increased significantly in recent years. In India, most people with high financial backgrounds always go for the prescribed branded drug. But it is a huge burden for the people in the middle class to spend on branded medicines. People can be benefitted from this website by knowing the equivalent substituent for the branded medicine they consume and the feedbacks received by the people consuming the same medicine. By knowing the equivalent substituent of the medicine they can consult with the doctor about whether they can use that medicine as it is cost-efficient. The consumers will trust the generic medicines by going through the feedbacks which are posted by people with the same health conditions. The people who are benefitted from generic medicines can post their feedback through this website, so other consumers who are hesitating to use these medicines will get aware. Generic medicines are typically 30% - 80% cheaper than originator equivalents. However, as the study shows, the price of some generic medicines available under JAS is costlier than the corresponding branded medicine available in the market. This suggests that the existing pricing of JAS would actually increase the OOP expenditure of patient households, which fails the purpose and objective of the scheme. For this problem, the prices of the medicine should be regularized. The prices of medicines that are relatively much cheaper than the branded medicines can be increased slightly. The profit obtained from increasing such medicines prices can be utilized to lower the generic medicine prices which are more than the branded medicines."}]
