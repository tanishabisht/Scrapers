It prevents anyone from going to different social platform to communicate with a sigle person. It can also be used to accept payments which are transferred from one person to another with the help of UPI , so the commision which they used to give to other platform is saved ."}, {"idNo": 1, "name": "Scienocyde", "desc": "Science Fair Management System", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/scienocyde-d61a", "githubLinks": ["https://github.com/Koderz-SI/Scienocyde", "http://scienocyde.pythonanywhere.com/"], "special_mention": " ", "stacksUsed": ["Django", "JavaScript", "CSS3", "HTML5"], "longDesc": "The problem Scienocyde solves\nIn this covid period, school and college-level science fairs are hardly taking place. So, we have built a website where different organizing teams can host their events, and students can participate in a science fair by going through the list and details of different organizations. Also, people who aren't participating can go through the projects and learn.\nBrief:\nHost - One can host a science fair and get a dashboard. In the dashboard, the Host can see the details and submissions of the participants registered to the event that he hosted.\nParticipant - A participant can check out the science fair section, where he can find the list of hosted Science fairs. He/She can check the details of the event and can then apply accordingly.\nDuring the offline Science Exhibitions, all the students were allowed to go through the projects irrespective of they are a participant or not! Thus, keeping this in mind, we have a \"Projects\" section where all the projects submitted by different students for various organizations are lined up. So, one can easily go through the projects and learn."}, {"idNo": 2, "name": "Subswap", "desc": "Swap Coupons with ease", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/couponhub-b83f", "githubLinks": ["https://subswap.space/", "https://github.com/subhasis020299/couponhub-frontend", "https://github.com/subhasis020299/couponhub-backend"], "special_mention": " ", "stacksUsed": ["Bootstrap", "React", "CSS", "Nodemailer", "Nodejs"], "longDesc": "The problem Subswap solves\nWith the advent of e-commerce and multiple UPI-based payment apps, there has been a proliferation of Coupons that the brands have been sending out to entice users to their platform. As such, a lot of these coupons generally go to waste as a vast majority of the population do not use them. While this creates friction for the user as they do not get the coupons that they'd want to use, it also panders to the businesses, who find that their coupons are not reaching the intended audience. Additionally, there are multiple coupon codes that can be used multiple times by multiple users. We are trying to build a platform to facilitate trading coupons so that you give away the coupon you have and receive one from the brand that you want.\nThis problem would continue to grow. At some stage, the growth hack associated with sending out coupons to entice a paying user into your fold would drop off due to this massive amount of value going to waste because of wasted targeting efforts and a lack of organized platform to make trades. In the future, this platform has the potential to grow into a formal marketplace for coupons, a peer-to-peer Groupon would be a good analogy, and create a new channel for companies to pump their marketing budgets into. Furthermore, you as a user would be able to make use of this platform and get the coupons you want, and not just the ones that the world has dealt out to you."}, {"idNo": 3, "name": "Healthy You", "desc": "Healthy You aims to make the appointment booking process seamless and create a community to educate users with the help of health tips, first aid advice, fitness tips and much more", "devfolioLink": "https://devfolio.co/submissions/healthhub-311c", "githubLinks": ["https://devfolio.co/"], "special_mention": " ", "stacksUsed": ["HTML", "JavaScript", "Socket.IO", "CSS3"], "longDesc": "The problem Healthy You solves\nInspiration\nCOVID-19 virus has wreaked havoc around the world, infecting millions and raising fears of uncertainty.
